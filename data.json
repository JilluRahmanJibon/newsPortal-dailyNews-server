        "description":"Sometimes, when I’m not feeling well, I want Yewande Komolafe’s brothy Thai curry with silken tofu and herbs, or Hetty McKinnon’s curry udon or Lara Lee’s smashed tempeh with homemade sambal. But earlier this week, I found myself craving a hot Japanese sweet potato with plenty of butter on top.I set it on a rack inside a Dutch oven with a couple of inches of water at the bottom — my makeshift steamer — and let it go quietly for half an hour or so. By then, the skin had loosened a little, easily slipping away from the yellow flesh, which was tender all the way through. I split it in half while it was still hot and heaped on butter, flaky salt and furikake. I highly recommend it. Cooking with steam is easy and way more compelling than it sounds. It can transform a vegetable with constant, gentle heat, softening without withering. If I’d had broccoli, I might have made David Tanis’s steamed broccoli with butter and bread crumbs. And if I’d had eggplant, I definitely would have turned to Hetty McKinnon’s beautiful liang ban qie zi — the recipe that taught me to appreciate steaming in the first place. I never expected to warm up to the technique, but cooking is like that, full of surprises. For example, I didn’t know that I should always check the ingredients on canned beans until I read Melissa Clark’s recent column about rosemary white beans with frizzled onions and tomato. Beans canned with salt tend to taste better. (Did you know? Did everyone?) The next time I buy canned beans, that little snippet of information will guide me.”",

There was no wincing in pain as he bowled before he went to the indoor nets for a session with the bat.During the last T20 World Cup, Shakib did not create the impact that was expected of the him as T20I skipper, bagging five wickets in six matches including a decent showing against India.

Many people enjoy hearty, warm breakfasts to start their day off on the right foot during this time. From savoury and sweet to dishes loaded with calories to the brim, Bangladeshis love to take full advantage of the winter season when it comes to their appetite.One popular breakfast dish in Bangladesh during the winter is paratha, which is a type of flatbread made from flour, salt, and water.

For that, you need an organised and thoughtful grocery list so that you do not have to zig and zag all around the store to find your desired items.Follow the tips mentioned below to ensure a prearranged breakfast grocery list and have a healthy breakfast! Eggs Scrumptious and protein-packed eggs are unquestionably a must-have breakfast item. Eggs are versatile — hard cooked or scrambled or incorporated in other dishes, they can be effortlessly used for a hearty breakfast. A fried egg sandwich sounds delicious, right? Eggs are enriched with protein and they will keep your tummy full until lunch. However, make sure you do not buy expired eggs.Filled with lots of fibre and important nutrients, fresh fruits undoubtedly ensure a balanced breakfast. Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, and grapes are great sources of vitamin C and we know it — an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

But if the mood demands something scrumptious, lack of time is the last thing that will work as an excuse! These recipes are dedicated for those express situations where time is short but craving is not.DESHI STYLE CREAMY CHEESY PASTA Kisan cheese is the best when it comes to cooking pasta sauces in Bangladesh, meaning the ones you want to whisk up in a jiffy. It melts softly and the gooey consistency lends a gratifying flavour to your sauce.For a quick deshi style margarita sauce made in a jiffy, cut tomatoes in quarters, add a few garlic cloves, coriander stalks, green chilli, for your taste, of course salt and olive oil, and boil it all together in a cup and half hot water. On a separate pot, boil your pasta. Once the tomatoes are squishy, blend them. In a wok, add olive oil and sauté the few chopped garlic till it is lightly brown and releases its flavour, then add the boiled pasta, the tomato sauce, and a few spoons of boiled pasta water. Let it simmer and add chunks of Kisan cheese, basil leaf or coriander for a fresh green flavour. Voila! You have your deshi pasta, though an Italian might shiver, but it is not a bad quick meal.",

        "description": "The US House of Representatives had to adjourn until yesterday (Thursday) as bitter infighting within the Republican ranks continues to paralyze the chamber and prevent the election of a new speaker.Conservative hardliners have spurned former president Donald Trump's pick Kevin McCarthy, who they accuse of being too moderate, making the 2023 speakership race the first in a century to require multiple rounds of voting.Despite six ballots over two days, McCarthy has failed to secure the 218 votes needed for the speakership, the third most powerful role in US politics after the presidency and vice presidency.Without a speaker, the chamber is unable to swear in members, start filling committees, tackle legislation or open any of the investigations they have promised into President Joe Biden.Unable to break the stalemate, the House abruptly adjourned until noon on Thursday, allowing Republicans a few precious hours to regroup and settle on a new strategy before going back into the fray.Roughly 20 Republicans have blocked the California congressman's path to the gavel until he capitulates to their agenda, leaving the party unable to capitalize so far on the slim majority it secured in November's mid-term elections.McCarthy, a member of the Republican leadership for more than a decade, has already agreed to many of the group's demands, but opposition to his candidacy from within his own party has only seemed to harden.",

        "description": "Republican Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker of the US House of Representatives early yesterday, after making extensive concessions to a group of right-wing hardliners that raised questions about the party's ability to govern.The 57-year-old Californian suffered one final humiliation when Representative Matt Gaetz withheld his vote on the 14th ballot as midnight approached, prompting a scuffle in which fellow Republican Mike Rogers had to be physically pulled away.McCarthy's victory in the 15th ballot brought an end to the deepest congressional dysfunction in over 160 years. But it sharply illustrated the difficulties that he will face in leading a narrow and deeply polarised majority.He won at last on a margin of 216-212. He was able to be elected with the votes of fewer than half the House members only because six in his own party withheld their votes - not backing McCarthy as leader, but also not voting for another contender.",

        "description": "Republican Kevin McCarthy on Friday picked up support from right-wing hardliners in the U.S. House of Representatives who had blocked his speakership bid, but it was not enough to end the deepest congressional dysfunction in more than 150 years.In a 12th round of voting in four days, 14 Republicans who previously opposed McCarthy voted for him in a sign that his prospects may be improving after he offered the holdouts a range of concessions that would limit his clout if he succeeds in becoming speaker of the House.But seven fellow Republicans still voted against him, leaving him three votes short of the majority needed to win the speaker's gavel and prompting his supporters to put his nomination forward for a 13th vote.Watch here and you'll see some people who have been voting against me voting for me, McCarthy, 57, said before Friday's vote.Republicans' weaker-than-expected performance in November midterm elections left them with a narrow 222-212 majority and gives outsized power to the right-wing hardliners who oppose McCarthy's leadership.They have railed against McCarthy, accusing him of being soft and too open to compromise with President Joe Biden and his Democrats, who also control the U.S. Senate.",

        "title": "Plant-based eating can transform health in surprising ways ",
        "description": "In recent years, there has been a noteworthy shift towards plant-based eating patterns, with more and more people choosing to include more fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, and nuts into their diets. This trend is not without good reason, as there are numerous health benefits associated with plant-based eating. This article will explore six critical ways in which plant-based diets can support good health and well-being.One of the most well-known benefits of plant-based diets is their potential to support weight management. Several studies have shown that people who follow plant-based diets tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) and are less likely to be overweight or obese than those who consume a more traditional diet high in animal products. This may be due in percentage to the statistic that plant-based diets are typically high in fibre and low in calories, which can aid with weight control. Additionally, plant-based foods are often more filling than animal-based foods, which may help to reduce overall caloric intake.Eating a plant-based diet may also support heart health. Plant-based diets are rich in antioxidants, which can support to shield against oxidative stress and inflammation, two key drivers of heart disease. Plant-based diets are also high in fibre, which has been revealed to decrease cholesterol levels and improve blood pressure. Moreover, plant-based diets are low in saturated fat, a significant risk factor for heart disease.Plant-based diets may also be helpful for those looking to manage their diabetes. Several studies have shown that plant-based diets can progress blood sugar control and lessen the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This may be partly because plant-based diets are often rich in fibre and low in unhealthy fats, which can help regulate blood sugar levels. Besides, plant-based diets are often high in antioxidants and other phytochemicals exposed to have anti-inflammatory effects, which can be beneficial for those with diabetes",

        "title": "Wisdom for inner peace",
        "description": "What was Socrates' most famous saying? Some say, Know thyself and some mention, There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance. Socrates taught us that people should care less about their bodies and possessions and more about their souls, saying, Wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth. Most of us are becoming so materialistic in today's fast-paced and stressful world  that the definition of peace and happiness becomes confusing to the younger generation. Sometimes they cannot differentiate between internal peace and external peace. Internal peace represents an individual's peace, while external peace represents peace in the surroundings and society which may or may  not be real.Fake happiness and peace outside may sabotage inner peace. Most of the time, these are things like  worrying, taking things personally, having unrealistic expectations, and becoming jealous. At the end of the day, these elements will combine to form a silent killer known as 'stress', that will turn to anxiety and depression. The power of inner peace calms our mind and, allows us to see our path much more clearly and helps us focus on our goals.Happiness comes from inner peace. The main form of mental training is helping others with kindness, along with forgiveness and gratitude. Contemplating has many mental health benefits, such as reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. But we must first change our mindsets to be more helpful and adjustable, to find our own destinations of tranquilly that we seek.",

        "description": "Temperatures are dropping, and the days are getting shorter. Shorter days mean less sun and vitamin D. So, in addition to pulling out the wool sweaters, we need to winterise our diets to make sure we get the vitamin D we need this season.Vitamin controls body functions. It helps bones and teeth absorb calcium. Both calcium and vitamin D are important for bone health and muscle strength, which may explain why we need more as we age and our muscles weaken and the tendency for falls becomes greater. We produce less vitamin D from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays as we age. Vitamin D deficiency causes aching bones.Sunshine is a good source of vitamin D. Our skin produces vitamin D when exposed to UV rays. This process requires direct sun exposure without sunscreen. 10-15 minutes of strong sunshine on your arms and face at least twice a week should meet your vitamin D needs.Multivitamins, many calcium supplements, and some fortified foods contain vitamin D. Without vitamin D, the body cannot absorb dairy's calcium. Under 50s can get enough vitamin D from two cups of fortified milk. Fatty fish oils and salmon, sardines, and tuna are also good sources of vitamin D, as are fortified soy milks, margarines, cereal, eggs, and orange juice.",

        "description": "Immunotherapies have gained much attention nowadays in the treatment of cancer. Among them, therapeutic DNA cancer vaccines are now considered a very promising strategy to activate the immune system against cancer tumour.DNA-mediated immunisation began in the 1990s. DNA vaccines have been developed to treat a variety of pathologies, including allergies, infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. To date, several preclinical and clinical studies have adopted strategies to better exploit the potential of DNA vaccination. The success in therapeutic vaccination is still limited even in preclinical models. It is due to the different mechanisms of resistance during tumour development tumour.DNA vaccines alone are not able to overcome the tumour immune escape. Therefore, we prefer combination therapy (e.g., radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, surgical removal) with this strategy.Encoded antigen(s) selection: The antigen type, i.e., tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) or neoantigens. TAAs have been identified for most tumours, but immune tolerance can limit their efficiency. On the other hand, neoantigen identification is time consuming and expensive, and these antigens do not reflect the tumour heterogeneity in the individual patient (e.g., in metastasis)",

        "title": "Looking toward a cure for Hepatitis B",
        "description": "Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be effectively treated with an oral nucleoside or nucleotide analog (NA). Still, lifelong daily medication is required and the clinical rebound that results from stopping medication can be severe. As is the case for other chronic viral infections, the holy grail of treatment would be a molecule to induce permanent remission with a delimited course of treatment. One proposed compound is the antisense nucleotide bepirovirsen, which inactivates HBV RNA in multiple capacities and limits viral protein synthesis.In a worldwide, multicenter, manufacturer-supported, phase 2B trial, researchers randomized 457 adults with chronic HBV infection to one of four dosing schedules of weekly bepirovirsen administered subcutaneously. Participants were mostly white or Asian men; half were also receiving NA treatment. After 12 or 24 weeks of bepirovirsen and 24 weeks of treatment-free follow up, 26 participants (6%) maintained persistently undetectable HB surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA. If viral blips were discounted, the number with a sustained response rose to 31.Factors correlating with sustained response included low HbSAg level at study entry and randomisation to the highest dose and longest duration of bepirovirsen. Adverse effects included injection-site reactions, fever, and in two patients, severe hepatitis requiring hospitalisation.While these results are perhaps not as dramatic as desired, they still suggest that, with adjustments in dose or duration, a course of bepirovirsen (or another antisense agent) may incapacitate HBV without the need for ongoing treatment.",
