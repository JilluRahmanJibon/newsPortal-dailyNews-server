		"title": "The Magic of Cooking With Steam",
		"description": "Sometimes, when I’m not feeling well, I want Yewande Komolafe’s brothy Thai curry with silken tofu and herbs, or Hetty McKinnon’s curry udon or Lara Lee’s smashed tempeh with homemade sambal. But earlier this week, I found myself craving a hot Japanese sweet potato with plenty of butter on top.I set it on a rack inside a Dutch oven with a couple of inches of water at the bottom — my makeshift steamer — and let it go quietly for half an hour or so. By then, the skin had loosened a little, easily slipping away from the yellow flesh, which was tender all the way through. I split it in half while it was still hot and heaped on butter, flaky salt and furikake. I highly recommend it. Cooking with steam is easy and way more compelling than it sounds. It can transform a vegetable with constant, gentle heat, softening without withering. If I’d had broccoli, I might have made David Tanis’s steamed broccoli with butter and bread crumbs. And if I’d had eggplant, I definitely would have turned to Hetty McKinnon’s beautiful liang ban qie zi — the recipe that taught me to appreciate steaming in the first place. I never expected to warm up to the technique, but cooking is like that, full of surprises. For example, I didn’t know that I should always check the ingredients on canned beans until I read Melissa Clark’s recent column about rosemary white beans with frizzled onions and tomato. Beans canned with salt tend to taste better. (Did you know? Did everyone?) The next time I buy canned beans, that little snippet of information will guide me.”",

However, the board did not receive the required clearances from the required agencies to give the go ahead.Instead, Shakib, having claimed he could fix the BPL in less than two months as CEO, was getting into the grind of things in his own way.The 35-year-old, who found some form with the bowl during India's recent tour of Bangladesh, had been troubled by injury but yesterday bowled in the nets after a long time. There was no wincing in pain as he bowled before he went to the indoor nets for a session with the bat.During the last T20 World Cup, Shakib did not create the impact that was expected of the him as T20I skipper, bagging five wickets in six matches including a decent showing against India. However, his performance with the bat in the showpiece event was concerning as he managed just 44 runs in five matches at an average below nine.",

Cinema isn't reality, Sohel added. Sohel also responded to Shakib saying that the Dhaka Premier League was better run than the BPL. Shakib doesn't often play in the premier division (Dhaka Premier League] matches. But till now he hasn't missed a BPL fixture. I don't think that is a valid argument.",

This combination provides a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and vegetables to fuel the body for the day ahead.Another winter breakfast favourite in Bangladesh is shingara, which is a savoury fried pastry filled with potatoes, lentils, or minced meat.

Nothing in Bangladesh completely captures the spirit of winter like a barbecue with your closest friends! You could simply buy some burgers and hot dogs, invite some friends over, and call it a BBQ party, or you could go a little further with some essential preparation and a carefully considered menu and surprise your guests with your culinary prowess. Here are just some things you can do to up the barbecue-host game.Plan your party A guest list is the first thing any decent barbecue party needs. A BBQ party can only be successful if all participants work together and share the party's expenses and duties. Spread the expense and the love all at once! Nowadays, using Facebook to plan an event is the simplest option. Make a private gathering, then invite your guests. Choose a day that will be manageable for everyone, preferably a weekend, or a holiday.Make sure you have three times the amount of fuel or charcoal needed to cook dinner in the propane tank or on the charcoal grill, respectively. You do not want to leave the party in the middle of cooking for charcoal or gas and allow the meat on the grills cool.",

Having a well-stocked kitchen and freezer means you can mix and match different food items and grab a convenient and filling breakfast easily. For that, you need an organised and thoughtful grocery list so that you do not have to zig and zag all around the store to find your desired items.Follow the tips mentioned below to ensure a prearranged breakfast grocery list and have a healthy breakfast! Eggs Scrumptious and protein-packed eggs are unquestionably a must-have breakfast item. Eggs are versatile — hard cooked or scrambled or incorporated in other dishes, they can be effortlessly used for a hearty breakfast. A fried egg sandwich sounds delicious, right? Eggs are enriched with protein and they will keep your tummy full until lunch. However, make sure you do not buy expired eggs.Filled with lots of fibre and important nutrients, fresh fruits undoubtedly ensure a balanced breakfast. Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, and grapes are great sources of vitamin C and we know it — an apple a day keeps the doctor away. It is tasty and easy to eat on the go, making it an ideal choice for people who are in a rush in the morning.",

But if the mood demands something scrumptious, lack of time is the last thing that will work as an excuse! These recipes are dedicated for those express situations where time is short but craving is not.DESHI STYLE CREAMY CHEESY PASTA Kisan cheese is the best when it comes to cooking pasta sauces in Bangladesh, meaning the ones you want to whisk up in a jiffy. It melts softly and the gooey consistency lends a gratifying flavour to your sauce.For a quick deshi style margarita sauce made in a jiffy, cut tomatoes in quarters, add a few garlic cloves, coriander stalks, green chilli, for your taste, of course salt and olive oil, and boil it all together in a cup and half hot water. On a separate pot, boil your pasta. Once the tomatoes are squishy, blend them. In a wok, add olive oil and sauté the few chopped garlic till it is lightly brown and releases its flavour, then add the boiled pasta, the tomato sauce, and a few spoons of boiled pasta water. Let it simmer and add chunks of Kisan cheese, basil leaf or coriander for a fresh green flavour. Voila! You have your deshi pasta, though an Italian might shiver, but it is not a bad quick meal.",

		"title": "Plant-based eating can transform health in surprising ways ",
		"description": "In recent years, there has been a noteworthy shift towards plant-based eating patterns, with more and more people choosing to include more fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, and nuts into their diets. This trend is not without good reason, as there are numerous health benefits associated with plant-based eating. This article will explore six critical ways in which plant-based diets can support good health and well-being.One of the most well-known benefits of plant-based diets is their potential to support weight management. Several studies have shown that people who follow plant-based diets tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) and are less likely to be overweight or obese than those who consume a more traditional diet high in animal products. This may be due in percentage to the statistic that plant-based diets are typically high in fibre and low in calories, which can aid with weight control. Additionally, plant-based foods are often more filling than animal-based foods, which may help to reduce overall caloric intake.Eating a plant-based diet may also support heart health. Plant-based diets are rich in antioxidants, which can support to shield against oxidative stress and inflammation, two key drivers of heart disease. Plant-based diets are also high in fibre, which has been revealed to decrease cholesterol levels and improve blood pressure. Moreover, plant-based diets are low in saturated fat, a significant risk factor for heart disease.Plant-based diets may also be helpful for those looking to manage their diabetes. Several studies have shown that plant-based diets can progress blood sugar control and lessen the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This may be partly because plant-based diets are often rich in fibre and low in unhealthy fats, which can help regulate blood sugar levels. Besides, plant-based diets are often high in antioxidants and other phytochemicals exposed to have anti-inflammatory effects, which can be beneficial for those with diabetes",

		"description": "What was Socrates' most famous saying? Some say, Know thyself and some mention, There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance. Socrates taught us that people should care less about their bodies and possessions and more about their souls, saying, Wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth. Most of us are becoming so materialistic in today's fast-paced and stressful world  that the definition of peace and happiness becomes confusing to the younger generation. Sometimes they cannot differentiate between internal peace and external peace. Internal peace represents an individual's peace, while external peace represents peace in the surroundings and society which may or may  not be real.Fake happiness and peace outside may sabotage inner peace. Most of the time, these are things like  worrying, taking things personally, having unrealistic expectations, and becoming jealous. At the end of the day, these elements will combine to form a silent killer known as 'stress', that will turn to anxiety and depression. The power of inner peace calms our mind and, allows us to see our path much more clearly and helps us focus on our goals.Happiness comes from inner peace. The main form of mental training is helping others with kindness, along with forgiveness and gratitude. Contemplating has many mental health benefits, such as reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. But we must first change our mindsets to be more helpful and adjustable, to find our own destinations of tranquilly that we seek.",

		"title": "Winterise your diet: Vitamin D is key in the cooler months",
		"description": "Temperatures are dropping, and the days are getting shorter. Shorter days mean less sun and vitamin D. So, in addition to pulling out the wool sweaters, we need to winterise our diets to make sure we get the vitamin D we need this season.Vitamin controls body functions. It helps bones and teeth absorb calcium. Both calcium and vitamin D are important for bone health and muscle strength, which may explain why we need more as we age and our muscles weaken and the tendency for falls becomes greater. We produce less vitamin D from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays as we age. Vitamin D deficiency causes aching bones.Sunshine is a good source of vitamin D. Our skin produces vitamin D when exposed to UV rays. This process requires direct sun exposure without sunscreen. 10-15 minutes of strong sunshine on your arms and face at least twice a week should meet your vitamin D needs.Multivitamins, many calcium supplements, and some fortified foods contain vitamin D. Without vitamin D, the body cannot absorb dairy's calcium. Under 50s can get enough vitamin D from two cups of fortified milk. Fatty fish oils and salmon, sardines, and tuna are also good sources of vitamin D, as are fortified soy milks, margarines, cereal, eggs, and orange juice.",

		"description": "Immunotherapies have gained much attention nowadays in the treatment of cancer. Among them, therapeutic DNA cancer vaccines are now considered a very promising strategy to activate the immune system against cancer tumour.DNA-mediated immunisation began in the 1990s. DNA vaccines have been developed to treat a variety of pathologies, including allergies, infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. To date, several preclinical and clinical studies have adopted strategies to better exploit the potential of DNA vaccination. The success in therapeutic vaccination is still limited even in preclinical models. It is due to the different mechanisms of resistance during tumour development tumour.DNA vaccines alone are not able to overcome the tumour immune escape. Therefore, we prefer combination therapy (e.g., radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, surgical removal) with this strategy.Encoded antigen(s) selection: The antigen type, i.e., tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) or neoantigens. TAAs have been identified for most tumours, but immune tolerance can limit their efficiency. On the other hand, neoantigen identification is time consuming and expensive, and these antigens do not reflect the tumour heterogeneity in the individual patient (e.g., in metastasis)",

To present this problem with data and create a platform for discussion with leading experts, the first in-person Bangladesh launch of the 2022 report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change took place on Thursday, 22 December 2022 at the Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF).The event provided an opportunity to acknowledge and examine the impacts climate change has had on Bangladesh across timeframes covering the past, present, and future. The imminent and necessary steps towards alleviating some of the predicaments were also discussed.During the event, findings of the 2022 Lancet Countdown Report in the context of Bangladesh were highlighted.

		"title": "Looking toward a cure for Hepatitis B",
		"description": "Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be effectively treated with an oral nucleoside or nucleotide analog (NA). Still, lifelong daily medication is required and the clinical rebound that results from stopping medication can be severe. As is the case for other chronic viral infections, the holy grail of treatment would be a molecule to induce permanent remission with a delimited course of treatment. One proposed compound is the antisense nucleotide bepirovirsen, which inactivates HBV RNA in multiple capacities and limits viral protein synthesis.In a worldwide, multicenter, manufacturer-supported, phase 2B trial, researchers randomized 457 adults with chronic HBV infection to one of four dosing schedules of weekly bepirovirsen administered subcutaneously. Participants were mostly white or Asian men; half were also receiving NA treatment. After 12 or 24 weeks of bepirovirsen and 24 weeks of treatment-free follow up, 26 participants (6%) maintained persistently undetectable HB surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA. If viral blips were discounted, the number with a sustained response rose to 31.Factors correlating with sustained response included low HbSAg level at study entry and randomisation to the highest dose and longest duration of bepirovirsen. Adverse effects included injection-site reactions, fever, and in two patients, severe hepatitis requiring hospitalisation.While these results are perhaps not as dramatic as desired, they still suggest that, with adjustments in dose or duration, a course of bepirovirsen (or another antisense agent) may incapacitate HBV without the need for ongoing treatment.",

On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not the same.

But, despite the influence of worldwide events, our economy still stands strong In fact, in a new report gathered from statistics gleaned by the International Monetary Fund, Bangladesh has now been declared the 35th largest economy in the world with a GDP size of $460.8 billion  It's no surprise, of course. Bangladesh has been on a ceaseless forward trajectory in terms of its development, a direct consequence of our aspirations towards achieving middle income status within the next few decades, not to mention our industries, both established and fledgling, and the forward momentum brought on by our burgeoning start-ups"

This is an uber-racist Raj where the Viceroy tells his minions that a British bullet costs one whole pound sterling and should not be wasted on the natives, whose lives are cheaper and therefore should be ended by means less costly One of the protagonists is Bheem, an Adivasi man sent to rescue a little girl who was abducted by the evil Viceroy's even more evil wife, who likes to scream stuff like there is no blood, flog him harder. Bheem hides among Delhi's Muslims as a mechanic, taking on the name Akhter The British are alerted to his presence by the Nizam of Hyderabad, and a Desi policeman named Ram volunteers to catch him. This western dressed, Anglicized guy is quite the British boot licker by the day, but is there more to him than meets the eye? The two become friends by chance, without knowing each other's identity. What happens when they find out the truth"

		"description": "One of the sadnesses of the political economy is that we simply never will have a perfect tax system. We do know what a perfect system would look like -- or at least the most efficient that could be crafted.  We also know that if we actually had such a tax system then there would be a revolt -- fortunately, at the ballot box these days. The problem is simply that we humans are, well, human. And what we think is fair is not always what is efficient. As we desire to have a tax system that is both fair and also efficient then this poses something of a problem for us all. This is the problem that faces us as we consider the proposals from Rapid (Research and Policy Integration for Development). They tell us that the Bangladeshi tax system raises some 65% of total revenue from indirect taxation and only 35% from direct. Other countries in much the same situation, or most of the more developed ones, do this rather the other way around -- something like 70% from direct taxes"

Achieving gender equality and giving women and girls more decision-making authority are also targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 The new model for women's development that is currently being considered on a worldwide scale has mostly concentrated on four areas, one of which is the political empowerment of women. These areas also consist of the political empowerment of women; women's ownership of land and natural resources; decent working conditions, wages, and remuneration; and peace and justice or fairness Participation in politics on the part of women is a necessary pre-condition for both gender equality and an authentic democracy. It is even more crucial for young girls to see other young women in leadership positions since this can improve their sense of self-worth, confidence, and elevate their aspirations"
